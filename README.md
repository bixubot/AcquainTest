# AcquainTest

This is the first iOS application attempted by Mutian Chen and Binwei Xu. The application is designed to be an interactive social platform where users can connect and challenge each other for their knowledge of the friends, named AcquainTest. 

The UI and logo design is done by Binwei Xu. Special thanks to Brian Voong, the owner and blogger of Lets Build That App, who inspired and guided us with excellent video tutorials and answers to specific questions.
